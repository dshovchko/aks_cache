This is last patches for Textpattern plugin aks_cache (http://textpattern.org.ua/plugins/aks_cache) that allows you to store cache in the database or files.

To install, grab the current version of the compressed plugin (aks_cache.txt) and paste into the plugin field in Textpattern.

As long as it's been installed & activated, you're ready to go.
